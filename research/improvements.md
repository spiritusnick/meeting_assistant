# Meeting Assistant Improvements

## Database Integration

We've implemented a Prisma-based database solution for storing meeting data, which provides:

- Structured data storage for meetings, transcriptions, and summaries
- Better query capabilities compared to the previous file-based storage
- Type safety through Prisma's generated types
- Improved data integrity with relationship management

### Implementation Details

1. Created `db.ts` utility that provides a clean API for database operations:
   - `initDatabase()`: Sets up the database connection
   - `saveMeeting()`: Saves meeting data with transcription and summary
   - `listMeetings()`: Gets all saved meetings
   - `loadMeeting()`: Retrieves a specific meeting
   - `deleteMeeting()`: Removes a meeting

2. Integrated with the existing application flow in `main.ts`:
   - Database is initialized on application startup
   - All meeting operations now use the database utility

## TypeScript Migration

Converted key application files from JavaScript to TypeScript:

1. `summarize.ts`: Meeting summary generation and storage
2. `transcribe.ts`: Audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API
3. `email.ts`: Email functionality for sharing summaries
4. `preload.ts`: Electron preload script with proper TypeScript interfaces

Benefits:
- Type safety across the application
- Better developer experience with autocompletion and error checking
- Improved documentation through TypeScript interfaces
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

### Module System Updates

Updated the application to use ES modules:
- Set `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Changed module configuration in tsconfig.json
- Added .js extensions to import statements for ES module compatibility

## Testing Notes

The improvements have been tested to ensure:
- TypeScript compilation works correctly
- Database operations function as expected
- The application maintains backward compatibility

## Future Improvements

1. **Frontend TypeScript Conversion**: Complete the TypeScript migration for React components
2. **Electron Type Definitions**: Add comprehensive typing for Electron IPC communication
3. **Database Migrations**: Implement proper migration system for database schema changes
4. **Test Suite**: Add unit and integration tests for the backend functionality
5. **UI Enhancements**: Improve the user interface for database operations
6. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for database operations
7. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and authentication for multi-user support
