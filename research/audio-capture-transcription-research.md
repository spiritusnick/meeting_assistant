1. Connect the microphone to an `AVAudioInputNode`
2. Capture system audio via virtual audio device
3. Use `AVAudioEngine`'s `synchronizationClock` to align streams
4. Process, mix, and record both streams

**Code Example (Conceptual):**
```swift
let engine = AVAudioEngine()
let micInput = engine.inputNode
let systemAudioInput = engine.inputNode // From virtual device
let mixer = engine.mainMixerNode

engine.connect(micInput, to: mixer, format: micInput.outputFormat(forBus: 0))
engine.connect(systemAudioInput, to: mixer, format: systemAudioInput.outputFormat(forBus: 0))

// Start recording
try engine.start()
```
