### Technical Stack Recommendations

#### Audio Capture and Processing
- **BlackHole**: Virtual audio device for system audio capture
- **Core Audio Framework**: For direct access to audio streams
- **AudioKit**: For audio processing and manipulation
- **FFmpeg**: For audio format conversion if needed

#### Transcription Engine
- **Whisper AI**: Local transcription for privacy and reduced latency
- **Vosk**: Alternative offline speech recognition
- **WebSpeech API**: For browser extension option

#### Backend/Core
- **Electron**: For cross-platform desktop application
- **Node.js**: For backend processing
- **Express**: For API endpoints if needed
- **SQLite**: For local storage of transcripts and settings

#### Frontend
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Electron Store**: For persistent settings

#### Cloud Integration
- **OpenAI API**: For summarization and insights
- **Azure AD Authentication Library**: For Microsoft SSO integration
- **Intune SDK**: For corporate security compliance

#### Mobile Integration (Future)
- **React Native**: For iOS companion app
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between desktop and mobile

### Standalone App vs. Browser Extension

#### Standalone App (Electron)

**Pros:**
- Full system-level access to audio devices
- Better performance for audio processing and transcription
- Works across all meeting platforms without platform-specific code
- More robust offline capabilities
- Better security control for corporate environments
- Can implement deeper OS integration

**Cons:**
- Larger installation footprint
- Requires separate installation and updates
- More complex deployment in corporate environments
- Higher development complexity

#### Browser Extension

**Pros:**
- Easier distribution through browser stores
- Simpler updates
- Lighter resource footprint
- More familiar installation process for users
- Potentially easier approval in some corporate environments

**Cons:**
- Limited access to system audio (browser tab audio only)
- Platform-specific implementations needed for each meeting service
- Limited offline capabilities
- Less control over security aspects
- Dependent on browser permissions and API changes

#### Recommendation

Based on the requirements for system audio capture across multiple meeting platforms and the need for corporate security compliance, the **standalone Electron app** is recommended as the primary approach. This provides the necessary system-level access for audio capture and offers better security controls for corporate environments.

A phased approach could include:
1. Develop the core standalone app first
2. Consider a browser extension as a complementary lightweight option later
3. Develop the iOS companion app as a final phase

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**
   - All audio processing and transcription should happen locally when possible
   - Transcripts should be encrypted at rest
   - Clear data retention policies with options for automatic deletion

2. **Corporate Compliance**
   - Microsoft Intune integration for device management
   - Support for Microsoft SSO authentication
   - Compliance with corporate data loss prevention (DLP) policies
   - Audit logging for security monitoring

3. **API Security**
   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Rate limiting for API calls
   - Minimal data transmission to external services

4. **Application Security**
   - Code signing for application distribution
   - Regular security updates
   - Sandboxed execution environment
   - Permission-based access to system resources

5. **User Control**
   - Clear recording indicators
   - Easy meeting pause/resume controls
   - Ability to redact sensitive information before sharing
   - Granular permission settings
