# Meeting Assistant Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The Meeting Assistant application is designed to capture system audio and microphone input during meetings, display audio waveforms, perform real-time transcription using Whisper AI, and eventually provide meeting summaries using OpenAI integration.

## Vision
Create a reliable, intuitive tool that helps users capture and transcribe meeting audio from various sources, providing accurate transcriptions and useful insights to improve meeting productivity.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- ✅ React-based UI with Electron for desktop application
- ✅ Audio device selection (including BlackHole for system audio)
- ✅ Basic audio capture from microphone and system audio
- ✅ Audio visualization with waveform display
- ✅ Basic post-recording transcription using Whisper API

### Phase 2: Enhanced Audio Capture & Real-time Transcription
- [ ] Improved system audio capture with better BlackHole integration
- [ ] Simultaneous capture of system audio and microphone
- [ ] Proper audio format conversion for optimal transcription
- [ ] Real-time streaming transcription (chunked processing)
- [ ] Advanced audio visualization with real-time updates

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Analysis
- [ ] Meeting summarization using OpenAI GPT models
- [ ] Speaker identification and diarization
- [ ] Automatic identification of action items and decisions
- [ ] Meeting analytics (speaking time, participation, etc.)
- [ ] Keyword extraction and topic modeling

### Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Features
- [ ] Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- [ ] Meeting platform detection (Teams, Zoom, Google Meet)
- [ ] Cloud storage and sync
- [ ] iOS companion app integration
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Technical Milestones
1. Stable audio capture with synchronized audio streams
2. Low-latency transcription with high accuracy
3. Secure and efficient data storage
4. Intuitive and responsive UI
5. Cross-platform compatibility

## Success Metrics
- Transcription accuracy rate > 95%
- Audio synchronization within 50ms tolerance
- UI responsiveness < 100ms for all interactions
- Minimal CPU/memory footprint during recording
- Positive user satisfaction scores in testing
