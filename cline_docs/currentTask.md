# Current Task: Building Meeting Assistant POC with React

## Task Overview
Building the proof-of-concept (POC) for the Meeting Assistant application with React integration. This involves setting up the project structure, implementing core components, and ensuring the basic functionality for audio capture, visualization, and transcription.

## Current Goals
1. Implement React-based UI to replace the existing vanilla HTML/JS interface
2. Set up proper project structure with React components
3. Ensure all existing functionality (audio capture, transcription) works with the React implementation
4. Configure proper build process with Webpack
5. Test the core functionality with BlackHole virtual audio device

## Implementation Details
- Using React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Maintaining Electron for cross-platform desktop app capabilities
- Using wavesurfer.js for audio visualization
- Leveraging OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription
- Using BlackHole for system audio capture

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper audio data flow from the main Electron process to the React renderer
- Managing component state for recording and transcription
- Setting up proper audio visualization updates
- Handling asynchronous operations (recording, transcription) with React state

## Next Steps
1. Complete implementation of React components
2. Test audio capture with BlackHole
3. Test transcription functionality with Whisper API
4. Refine UI/UX for better user experience
5. Implement real-time audio visualization updates
6. Begin planning for Phase 2 improvements (real-time transcription)
