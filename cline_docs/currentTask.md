# Current Task

## TypeScript and Database Enhancements

**Current Focus:** Converting the Meeting Assistant codebase to TypeScript and implementing a Prisma-based database solution.

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Converted `summarize.js` to TypeScript with proper type definitions
- [x] Converted `transcribe.js` to TypeScript with improved error handling
- [x] Converted `email.js` to TypeScript with interface definitions
- [x] Converted `preload.js` to TypeScript with comprehensive interface definitions
- [x] Created `db.ts` utility for database operations
- [x] Configured ES modules in the application
- [x] Integrated database initialization in the application startup
- [x] Updated imports across modules to use the new TypeScript versions
- [x] Created documentation of improvements in `research/improvements.md`
- [x] Converted React components to TypeScript (Transcription, Controls, DeviceSelector, StatusBar, EmailDialog)
- [x] Created centralized type definitions in `interfaces.ts`
- [x] Fixed ES modules import paths with proper file extensions
- [x] Updated `window.d.ts` with proper interface definitions
- [x] Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors

### In Progress
- [ ] Testing the application with the new TypeScript and database implementation
- [ ] Ensuring compatibility with existing data

### Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Convert any remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript
- [ ] Implement database migrations for schema changes
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Enhance error handling across the application
- [ ] Update UI components to reflect database-backed operations

### Technical Decisions
1. **ES Modules**: Chose to use ES modules (`type: module` in package.json) to align with modern JavaScript practices.
2. **Prisma ORM**: Selected Prisma for database operations due to its type safety and ease of use.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained file-based storage alongside database for compatibility.
4. **Interface-First Approach**: Defined TypeScript interfaces before implementation to ensure consistency.

### Notes
- The TypeScript migration improves code quality and maintainability
- The database implementation provides better data structure and query capabilities
- Current focus is on ensuring the application runs correctly with these changes
